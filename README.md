# PingPong

In this project I have created the PingPong game. This is a 2 player game where one player controls the paddle ( right paddle ) using "Up" and "Down" key and other player (left paddle) uses the "w" and "s" keys for up and down respectively.

I have used the class inheritance in the project, there are 4 different files namely main.py, ball.py, paddle.py and scoreboard.py 
The main.py is the file where I am using objects from other class and the main game-on logic is here. 
The ball.py contains the configurations regarding ball, it's size, movement, speed increment etc. 
The paddle.py contains the functionality regarding paddle, like the movement, shape, size etc. 
The scoreboard.py contains the scoreboard class, focusing on keeping score, triggering when game is over. 

I have used Turtle module of python to create all the objects.
